The map shows the evaluation of the wind energy potential for the operation of small wind turbines for a height of 10 metres above the medium building height or above ground for larger areas without development (model topography) and has a horizontal resolution of 25mx25m. Classification of the potential into 3 classes based on the average annual wind speed: good (>-4 m/s), mediocre (>2.5m/s and <4m/s), low (<2.5m/s)
